        <p id="flower">Whenever a company, group or organization communicates online, by email or similar, and stores
            and transfers
            data and information, it must ensure its IT security. The scale of a cyber attack is increasingly
            devastating and the risk of becoming a victim of a cyber attack is growing every day. What dangers
            emanate
            from cyber attacks and what areas does IT Security cover that protect against the growing threat of
            cyber
            crime? Below, we provide information on the methods and tactics of hackers and the responsibilities of IT

        <p1 class="fourth">What is IT Security?</p1>
        <hr color="red" height="2px" width="1200px" class="fifth">
        <p class="sixth">IT security is the protection of information and especially the processing of information. IT
            security is
            intended to prevent the manipulation of data and systems by unauthorized third parties. The meaning behind
            this is that socio-technical systems, i.e. people and technology, within companies / organizations and their
            data are protected against damage and threats. This does not only mean information and data, but also
            physical data centers or cloud services.</p>
        <p1 class="seventh">What is the objective of IT Security?</p1>
        <hr color="red" height="2px" width="1200px" class="eighth">
        <p class="nineth">Information has become more and more valuable over the last few years. Therefore it is all the
            more important
            to protect it. Information security is defined by the three IT protection goals of availability, integrity
            and confidentiality. These must be maintained. In addition, there are other parts to be added: Authenticity,
            accountability, non-repudiation and reliability.</p1>
        <p class="tenth">Confidentiality of Information</p>
        <p class="eleven">The confidentiality of IT Securitymeans that data is only accessible to certain authorized
            persons. For
            example, only a certain group of people can access the data it contains. In other words, access protection
            must be defined. This means that access rights must also be assigned.<br><br>

            Another central point in the confidentiality of information is the transport of data. This should always be
            encrypted, symmetrically or asymmetrically. This means that unauthorized persons cannot access the contents.
        </p>
        <p class="twele">Information Integrity</p>
        <p class="thirty">The integrity of the information should be seen, that the contents and data are always
            complete and correct.
            So the systems must also work together for their own benefit. In order to be able to use data, they must not
            be changed by means of a sales or processing operation. For this reason, it is also important to note that
            there is no possibility for the authoritative Dritte to have (part of) the data available. As it is only
            possible to make a mistake, it has to be proven that this art of manipulation can be prevented, that the
            safety can be improved and that it can be used.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="main">
        <p class="fifteen">Availability of Information</p>
        <p id="tiger">Ensuring the availability of the respective information means that data processing within the
            systems runs
            smoothly. The data must be able to be retrieved correctly<br> at the desired time. This means that the
            computer
            systems must be protected against failures. This is why there are also load tests to check the limits, so
            that<br> business operations are maintained in any case.</p>
        <p class="eighteen">Which areas include IT Security?</p>
        <hr color="red" height="2px" width="1200px" class="ninteen">

            class="twenty">
        <p class="twone">Endpoint Security</p>
        <p class="twtwo">All necessary end devices, i.e. PCs, notebooks, tablets and cell phones must be protected. This
            includes the<br> associated applications and operating systems. Endpoint security is about protecting
            everything
            that is <br>switched within the company network up to the Internet.</p>
        <p class="twthree">Internet & Cloud Security</p>


        <p class="twfive">User Security</p>
        <p class="twsix">Because they don’t know what they’re doing, even the users in your company can be a major risk.
            The IT
            department, where there is awareness, should be very careful<br> to counteract this. Whether through an
            application on the private smartphone or through updates on the laptop, the risk is there. If an email
            attachment is too large, it<br> should not be directed immediately to your private email address. The IT
            department must create user awareness so that every employee in the company pays the<br> greatest attention
            to
            the issue of IT security.</p>
        <p class="twseven">What impact does a cyber attack have on my data?</p>
        <hr color="red" height="2px" width="1200px" class="tweight">
        <p class="twnine">If one of these three areas of IT security is breached, this can have serious consequences for
            the companies
            and businesses affected. Cyber-attacks allow hackers to<br> access confidential information, such as
            internal
            information or personal data. Industrial espionage, misuse of credit card data or theft of personal
            identities can be the<br> consequence. Manipulated data can lead to the disruption of production because
            automated machines no longer function properly.</p>
        <p class="twten">Cyber Attack Methods: What attacks exist?</p>
        <hr color="red" height="2px" width="1200px" class="twele">
        <p class="twtwe">Cyber-crime is constantly changing and new methods are being developed to identify and exploit
            security
            holes. In general, IT Security is asymmetric: in order to <br>significantly damage a company’s operating
            procedures, a cyber-criminal must successfully exploit a single weakness. Companies, on the other hand, have
            to ensure <br>comprehensive protection to safeguard their IT security.</p>
        <p class="twthy">Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)</p>

    </div>

    <div class="footer">
        <p class="twfour">Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) means “advanced and persistent threat”. Hackers use a lot of
            time, effort
            and resources to penetrate a system. First they infiltrate a <br>computer to spy on internal processes and
            from
            there they sabotage the entire network. This gives cyber-criminals permanent access to a network and from
            there<br> they can spread more malware to attack the entire system. </p>
        <p class="therty">Malware </p>
        <p class="theone">Malware can be any type of malicious program that can cause damage to infected systems.<br>
            These include worms,
            viruses, Trojans and ransomware programs. WannaCry, Petya and Ryuk<br> in particular have demonstrated in
            recent
            years that malware is quite capable of bringing <br>companies to the brink of closure or even insolvency if
            IT
            Security is inadequate. <span class="dolo">More about<br>malware you can read here.</span></p>
        <p class="thetwo">Phishing</p>
        <p class="thethree">Phishing is an attempt at fraud carried out electronically, in which a fake email is sent to
            the<br> recipient,
            who often does not recognize it as such at first. This method of cyber-attack, in the <br>form of a
            professional
            looking email, is often designed to trick the recipient into revealing<br> confidential data. <span

            class="thefour">
        <p class="thefive">DDoS Attacks</p>
        <p class="thesix">DDoS stands for Distributed Denial Of Service. In a DDoS attack, bots cause a large number of
            requests to the
            victim’s server. As a result, <br>certain services are paralyzed because the affected servers are
            overloaded.
            Here you can find more information about DDoS attacks.</p>
        <p class="theeight">What is Critical Infrastructure?</p>
        <p class="thenine">Critical infrastructures are the companies, organizations and facilities that are essential
            for the
            maintenance of essential social functions, health, security and <br>economic and social well-being of the
            population. They include, for example, energy and water companies, logistics companies, hospitals and the
            financial sector. The <br>interruption or destruction of the operations of these companies would have a
            significant impact. Learn about the consequences and possible measures in case of <br>cyber-attacks on the
            energy and logistics sector, among others:</p>
